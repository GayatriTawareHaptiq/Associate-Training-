Of course. Based on the provided code, here is a complete README.md file for your Secure Blog project.

Secure Blog API üõ°Ô∏è‚úçÔ∏è
This project is a RESTful API for a simple blog platform, built with a strong emphasis on security using Spring Boot and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It provides a foundation for creating, viewing, and managing blog posts with secure, role-based access.

Key Features
‚úÖ JWT-based Authentication: Secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens. Users log in with credentials to receive a token for accessing protected routes.

üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Endpoints are protected based on user roles (e.g., USER, ADMIN). For example, only authenticated users can create posts.

‚úçÔ∏è RESTful API Endpoints: Clean, predictable endpoints for managing user authentication and blog posts.

üìñ Public & Protected Routes: Provides publicly accessible endpoints for reading posts and protected endpoints for creating or modifying them.

üì¶ JPA/Hibernate Integration: Uses Spring Data JPA for straightforward data persistence.

Technology Stack
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security

Language: Java

Database: Spring Data JPA / Hibernate (Configured for an in-memory H2 database for development, easily switchable to PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

Build Tool: Maven

API Specification: REST

API Endpoints
The following are the core endpoints available in the API.

Method	Endpoint	Protection	Description
POST	/login	Public	Authenticates a user by taking a username and password. Returns a JWT upon success.
GET	/posts	Public	Retrieves a list of all blog posts. Available to anyone without authentication.
POST	/posts	Protected (USER/ADMIN)	Creates a new blog post. Requires a valid JWT in the Authorization header.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Java (JDK 17 or later)

Apache Maven

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd secure-blog
Configure the application
Create or modify the src/main/resources/application.properties file. You will need to define your database connection details and a secret key for signing JWTs.

Example application.properties:

Properties

# Server Configuration
server.port=8080

# Database Configuration (Example for PostgreSQL)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/blog_db
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# JWT Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Use a long, random, and secure string for the secret key
jwt.secret=YourSuperSecretKeyForSigningJsonWebTokensWhichIsVeryLong
jwt.expiration=86400000 # 24 hours in milliseconds
Build the project
Use Maven to compile the code and package it into a JAR file.

Bash

mvn clean install
Run the application
Once the build is complete, you can run the application from the target directory.

Bash

java -jar target/secureblog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
The API will now be running on http://localhost:8080.
