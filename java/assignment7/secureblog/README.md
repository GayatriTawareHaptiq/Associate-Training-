Secure Blog API
This project is a simple yet secure REST API for a blog application, built using Spring Boot. It demonstrates best practices for building secure, stateless APIs using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. The application allows authenticated users to create blog posts, while all users can view them.

‚ú® Features
Secure REST endpoints for managing blog posts.

Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Endpoint protection using Spring Security.

Clean, layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository).

Comprehensive unit testing for the service and controller layers using JUnit 5 & Mockito.

In-memory H2 database for easy setup and testing.

üîå API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints. Note that some endpoints require a valid JWT Bearer token in the Authorization header.

Authentication
